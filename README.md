# Nordlicht

**Northern Lights for Your Goals**

Nordlicht (German for "Northern Lights") is your daily companion that keeps your big goals visible, even when life gets busy.

## What is this?

A simple email-based system that:

- **Reminds you daily** about your grand goals and what matters most
- **Lets you report back** on your progress, struggles, or thoughts
- **Uses AI** to understand your journey and keep you motivated

Think of it as having a thoughtful friend who checks in every day, remembers what you're working toward, and helps you stay on track.

## Why "Nordlicht"?

Just like the Northern Lights guide travelers in the dark, this app helps you navigate toward your goals when the path isn't clear.
